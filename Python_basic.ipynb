        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python is high level general purpose programming language very popular in industry for variuos uses like Web development, software development, automation, Data Science and Machine Learning.\n",
        " It is very popular among the developers for following reasons:\n",
        "    ·\tIts syntaxes are easy to learn, clear and concise format which reduces maintenance cost\n",
        "    ·\tIt is versatile, used for wide range of applications from web development, data analysis, machine learning, operation research, app development etc.\n",
        "    ·\tIt is rich with huge repositories and libraries helps developer to implement execute different tasks  with minimum effort\n",
        "    ·\tPython works with all platforms like Windows, Linux and Mac OS and also integrates with other systems and  languages.\n",
        "    ·\tIt is open source helps developer to  up skill easily without incuring any cost and also  helps develop a community support\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python Interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. It translates the high-level Python instructions in a line by line  sequence. It checks syntax error, converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecode, sending the code Python Virtual Machine for execution. Python Interpreter execute the code line by line and it helps to visualize the intermediate results, and debug on the run.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Python pre-defined keywords are reserved words with special tasks associated with it.\n",
        "Examples: Control Flow Kywords are like: if, else, for, while, function related keywords are def and return, tructural keywords such as class, import, lambda, with, and pass etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Keywords can not be used as veriable names because they are reserved words that define the syntax and structure of the language.If any keyword is used to define variable name then it will throw syntax error during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. There are 2 types of objects in Python, mutable and immutable. Mutable objects like list, dictionary, set can be changed after creation, allowing modification, addition, or removal of elements. While immutable objects can not altered after creation. Example of immutable objects are tuple and strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Lists are mutable because in can be  modified (adding, removing, or changing elements) after creation. This mutability supports use cases where dymanic changes are required during execution. Whereas tuples can not me modified after creation. This data type  is useful when data integrity is important and prevents developer to accidentally update values of the object during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \" == \" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. \"==\" is an example of comparison operators which compares values between 2 variables whereas \"in\" operators act as an identity operators compares object identities.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Logical operators are used combine logical conditions using \"and\", \"or\" and \"not\".\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Type casting in Python refers converting one data type to another using built in functions . It can be implicit (automatic by Python) or explicit (manual by the user). Common explicit type casting functions include int(), float(), and str(), which convert values to integer, float, and string types respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In Case of implicit type casting, Python interpreter automatically change the format of the object\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "a = 3\n",
        "b = 4.5\n",
        "c = a+b\n",
        "print(c) -> 7.5\n",
        "print(type(c)) -> float\n",
        "\n",
        "whereas, user has to manually change the format of  existing object by using int(), float(), and str() functions which convert values to integer, float, and string types respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. ConditionConditionals are useful to control the flow a program during decision making stage based on true or false conditions. Conditionals enables the program to execute different code blocks depending on varying inputs or scenarios, making the code dynamic and adaptable.Common conditionals include if, elif, and else statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In condionals, \"elif\" is usefule if there is more than 2 conditions. If first conditions under \"if\" statement fails then code is searching for next condition which is validated under \"elif\" condition. There can be multiple  \"elif\" blocks if there multiple decisons scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Loops are used in programming language to execute repetitive tasks or execute same code block multiple times.\n",
        "“For loop” iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes the block for each item.It is used when the total number of iterations is known and finite. “While loop”  repeats the block as long as a given condition is true. It is used when the number of iterations depends on dynamic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Consider an application that repeatedly asks a user to enter a command or a color until the user types \"exit\" or \"quit.\" Since the number of inputs is unknown ahead of time, the program cannot rely on a for loop with a predetermined number of iterations. Instead, a while loop checks continuously whether the input meets the exit condition, and only then stops running. This approach fits perfectly with situations where the loop must continue \"while\" a condition is true, such as waiting for user input or sensor data until a stopping criterion is achieved."
