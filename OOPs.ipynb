    "## Python OOPs Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Object Orient Programming (OOPs) based on objects that has data (attributes) and can performs methods (functions) on that data. This  programing approach helps models real world complex scenarios using  modular, reusable and maintainable codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Ans. In OOP, class is a blueprint or template for creating object. It defines common structure (attribute) and behaviors (methods) that all  of objects of that class will share.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Object is an instance of the class. It is an real world realization of the blueprint/template defined by the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Hiding complexities and showing only essential features whereas encapsulation comprises data and methods into a single unit. Abstract class simply the user’s view and only shows necessary details. Encapsulation protects object internal states by using access control maintain integrity. Abstraction hides implementation like if we use sum(a,b) function then we are not required to know how sum function works. While encapsulation hides information like inner implementation of buttons in mobile phone\n",
    " \n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Dunder (aka magic or special methods) methods are the methods defined by built-in classes in Python have names starting and ending with double underscores. These methods are able to customizes the behavior of built-in functions, operators, and syntax for user-defined classes. These methods are implicitly called by the python interpreter. These methods are mostly used for operator overloads. The double underscore naming convention helps prevent accidental overriding of these built-in methods by user-defined methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Inheritance defined as the process of child classes receiving the properties of parent class(s). Inheritance ensures the re usability of the features (attributes and methods/functions) of parent class in all other related child classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In OOP, polymorphism defined as the ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently depending on the data type or class of the object it is acting upon. It allows objects of various classes to be treated through a common interface, which makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. In python polymorphism is performed using 2 approaches a. method overloading and method overriding \n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, encapsulation is achieved primarily through naming conventions and the use of the @property decorator. Naming conventions are like Public, Private and Protected. \n",
    "By default, all members (attributes and methods) in a Python class are public and can be accessed from anywhere. Protected Members (Convention) are achieved using subclasses prefixed with a single underscore (_). To create \"private\" members, you use a double underscore (__) prefix. Python employs a mechanism called name mangling which changes the name of the attribute internally (e.g., __balance in a BankAccount class becomes _BankAccount__balance). \n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. IPython constructor is an instance method in a class, that is automatically called whenever a new object of the class is created. The constructor's role is to assign value to instance variables as soon as the object is declared. Constructor are created usinf special methods like  __new__ and __init__\n",
    " \n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Class methods are bound to class not an instance of that class.Class methods can access or modify the state of the instance belongs to that class.This makes them useful for tasks that involve manipulating shared data. Class methods uses @clasmethod decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator. In conclusion, static methods are used when you don't need access to class or instance state, and class \n",
    "methods are used when you need to access or modify class-level attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Method overloading is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (varying by number, type, or order).  Method overloading is not supported by Python. Even if you overload the  method, Python only takes into account the most recent definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Method overriding in OOP allows a child (sub)class provide its own specific version of a method that's already defined in its parent (super)class, using the same name, parameters, and return type, enabling runtime polymorphism  where the correct method runs based on the object type (parent or child). \n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. @property decorator allows the user to define class method as an attribute.This approach encapsulates logic (like validation or dynamic calculation) without forcing the user of the class to call explicit getter and setter methods. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. There are different types of data structures available in Python ecosystem. In OOP approach Classes are built to perform in built methods on object/instances associated with that Class irrespective of the data structures (attributes). In that scenario polymorphism  enables single function, method, or operator to behave differently depending on the data type or class of the object it is acting upon.\n",
    " \n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. An abstract class in Python serves as a blueprint for other classes, defining a common interface or structure that all subclasses must follow. A key characteristic is that an abstract class cannot be instantiated directly because it often contains one or more abstract methods that lack implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) advantages include better code organization using modularity, encapsulation, reusability via inheritance, flexibility accross different datatypes through polymorphism, easier maintenance and debugging, improved security, and scalability, all by modeling real-world entities as self-contained \"objects\".\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Instance Variables are unique to each object (instance) whereas, class variable are linked to class and same across all instances associated with class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a circle class value of pi is an an example of class variable which is used to calculate the area and circumference of the circle whereas radius is a instance variable instantiated under __init__ function whereever the specific object is created and can take different values for different object. \n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. multiple inheritance refers one child class may inherit the properties of multiple parent classes. Example a specific model of car can be an object of overall vehicle class and simultaneously be a part of sedan class inheriting the properties of both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of \" __ str_'and'_repr_\"methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \" __ str_' method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should  return a string representation of the object.This is what you see when you use the print() function or explicitly call str(my_object). \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the __repr__ method is to provide an unambiguous string representation of the object, primarily for developers during debugging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 'super()' function in Python is primarily used to access and call methods of a parent or sibling class [1]. Its significance lies in enabling cooperative multiple inheritance and cleanly managing class hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A static method is essentially a function defined inside a class that knows nothing about the class or its instance. It's a way to logically group a utility function with a class without requiring an instance of that class to be created. \n",
    "A class method, in contrast, receives the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named ‘cls’. This allows the method to access or modify class attributes or call other class methods, providing a way to work with the class as a whole rather than a specific instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works primarily through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch (runtime polymorphism). This allows objects of different classes that share a common base class (or interface) to be treated interchangeably, with Python automatically calling the correct method implementation based on the object's actual type at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Method chaining refers to calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object in a single expression. Each method call returns an object, often the same object (modified or not), allowing the subsequent method to operate on that object. In OOP, method chaining is implemented by returning self at the end of each method. \n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the __ call __ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The __call__ method write classes where the instances behave like functions and can be called like a function. When this method is defined, calling an object (obj(arg1, arg2)) automatically triggers obj.__call__(arg1, arg2). This makes objects behave like functions, enabling more flexible and reusable code.\n"
