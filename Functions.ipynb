    "## Theory Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Key difference are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tFunctions are defined independently while methods are defined under a class.\n",
    "2.\tFunctions are not linked to any specific object. Methods are essentially associated with object created as an instance under class. \n",
    "3.\tFunctions are called directly using their name while methods are called using “.” notation linked to object (object.method()).  \n",
    "4.\tMethods implicitly receive the object instance (self) as their first argument, allowing them to interact with the object's state. Functions do not have this implicit argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of  Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a,b):\n",
    "returns  a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add(5,6))\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of  method:\n",
    "\n",
    " class Dog:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "     def bark(self): #  method\n",
    "          print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Tom\")\n",
    "my_dog.bark() # Calling the method on the 'my_dog' object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Parameters are variables inside parentheses of  function name. parametrs values are expected to be provided by user during function call and wil be used inside function calculation. Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it is called and these values populate the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a,b=10):\n",
    "returns  a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add(5)) # Output= 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a is parameter and b is argument\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "Ans. One way of define a function is using def for a named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "def mul(a,b):\n",
    " return a*b\n",
    "Small anonymous Functions can be created using lambda \n",
    "\n",
    "lambda x, y: x*y\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be called in following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tDirect call by name:function_name() for no arguments, or function_name(arg1, arg2) with positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tUsing different argument styles:\n",
    "a.\tPositional arguments: based purely on order.\n",
    "b.\tKeyword arguments: specify parameter names explicitly\n",
    "c.\tMixed: positional first, then keyword.\n",
    "d.\tUnpacking iterables: function_name(*iterable) to expand a list/tuple into positional args.\n",
    "e.\tUnpacking dicts: function_name(**mapping) to expand a dict into keyword args.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThrough variables and data structures:\n",
    "a.\tAssign a function to a variable then call via that variable: alias = func; alias().\n",
    "b.\tStore functions in lists or dicts and call them from there (e.g., handlers\"event\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in a Python function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The 'return' statement in a Python function immediately exit the function and send a value or object back to where the function was called. It marks the end of the function's execution and allows the function to produce an output that can be stored in a variable or used elsewhere in the code. If no return statement is used or if it is used without a value, the function implicitly returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(a,b=10):\n",
    "returns  a+b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Iterators are object that is used to iterate iterables like list, tuples , set and dictionaries.\n",
    "Iterables on the other hand are sequential data/object which can return its elements on at a time or in other word, can be iterated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    " l = [1, 2, 3] \n",
    "Iter = iter(l)\n",
    "\n",
    "print (next(iter))\n",
    "print (next(iter))\n",
    "print (next(iter))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python Generators is a special type of function that act as iterators, allowing you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing the entire sequence in memory. They are particularly useful for handling large datasets or infinite sequences where generating all values at once would be memory-inefficient.\n",
    " \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    " def generator_function():\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "           yield i\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. One of the biggest advantages of generators is that they are memory efficient. Since a generator yields its values one by one, it does not need to store all of the values in memory at once.\n",
    " Generators are much more readable compared normal functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators can also be faster than regular loops, especially when working with large data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Lambda functions are very short anonymous functions, usually  defined in a single line.\n",
    "Lambda functions are combined with map and reduce functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: get_square = lambda x: x**2\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. map() function in Python is to apply a specified function to every item in one or more iterables (like lists or tuples) and return results for each elements of the iterables . \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "l = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    " l2 = list(map(lambda x: x**2, l))\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between `map()', 'reduce()', and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Map(), resuce() and filter() all these 3 functions are applied on iterables and yield results of the function on elements of the iterables. Only difference is map() is used to apply the function all elements of the iterables and returns all transformed elements of the iterables. Reduce() as name suggested, aggregate the values of iterables. Whereas, filter() is used to select elements from the iterables based on condition provided in filter function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "print(list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums)))\n",
    "print(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums))\n",
    "print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)))\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on this given\n",
    "list: [47,11,42,13];\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. reduce() takes a binary function (in this case, addition) and applies it cumulatively to the items of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration -1: 47 + 11 = 58\n",
    "Iteration - 2: 58+42 = 100\n",
    "Iteration - 3: 100+13 = 113\n",
    "Final result: 113\n",
    "\n"
